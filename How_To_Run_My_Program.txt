* This program needs an external library JFreeChart. I wrote my program on eclipse.
* You have to download JFreeChart version 1.0.18 on your PC. Then add the path of this library to 
  your project in eclipse.

* For this program the id of an admin is '000'. The name of admin is 'Wasif' and the
  role is 'Administrator'.
* Once you login with admin credentials you can see the other employee information. Then later you can
  restart the program and login with an employee id, name and role to see his options on this portal.
